<p><font size="6"><i>In December 2015,Two months after the first International School opened, our first library opened in one room of a former train depot on State Street and the School received its first private donation, a bequest of Rs300 to purchase library books.When the government efforted for increasing literacy rate in India under the slogan <span style="color:#1c87c9">"Padhega India tabhi toh badhega India"</span>, administrators realized the importance of establishing a more comprehensive library facility. Under the leadership of  <span style="color:#1c87c9">Manu Tiwari (1998-Present) and Prateek Jaiswal(1999-Present)</span>, the Indian Normal College's first professionally trained librarian, the library's collection grew from fewer than 4,000 to more than 53,000 volumes and moved, in 2018, from a single room in Lucknow (on what is now the University's Lucknow campus) to the 5 branches in different states of India . The basement of Kanpur IIT became the College Commons, a gathering place for students until early 2020 when it was converted into additional library space.</i></font></p></h2>
